## 1. Training Mode
After have all the environment download and installed, You can test out the simulator by opening it up and choosing "Training Mode".  Use the mouse or keyboard to navigate around the environment and see how it looks. After that you can started recording data from the training mode and saving it in a IMG folder after 

## 2.Data Analysis
Included in the IPython notebook called `Rover_Project_Test_Notebook.ipynb` are the functions from the lesson for performing the various steps of this project.  The notebook should function as is without need for modification at this point. But, first of all we starte making some notebooks applying all the lesons and examples for performing all steps of this project. Those notebooks are in folder named jupyter notebook.
## 3.Navigating Autonomously
To navigate autonomously we have to call `drive_rover.py`. We have to complete `perception.py` and `decision.py`. In these files we find the functions called `perception_step()` and `decision_step()` that we have to complete in order to run `drive_rover.py` and see how it works autonomously. All of these files could be found in file named `code`

`drive_rover.py` should work as is if you have all the required Python packages installed. Call it at the command line like this: 

```sh
python drive_rover.py
```  



Then you have to launch the simulator and choose "Autonomous Mode" and the rover starts to move!
